Observation:

I remember going to my local store and noticing that there was construction happening nearby. As I walked through the produce s
ection, I couldn't help but notice the all-too-familiar stench of stinky avocados. Despite the ongoing construction outside, th
e store seemed just as busy as ever, with shoppers trying to navigate their way around the workers and piles of materials. As I
 made my way to the checkout, I couldn't help but wonder how the construction might be affecting the quality of the produce. Pe
rhaps that was why the avocados were particularly pungent that day.
Thought:After examining all the relevant memories, it seems that the stinky avocados at my local store are a result of the ongo
ing construction near the store. I now know the likely reason behind the strange smell, and can make an informed decision about
 whether or not to purchase avocados from this store in the future.

Final Answer: The stinky avocados at my store are likely a result of the ongoing construction near the store, which has likely
disturbed the air quality in the area and affected the quality of the produce.
